abstract: 'Nuclear receptors are transcription factors that
regulate gene expression in a ligand-dependent
manner. They play key roles in several basic biological processes such as growth, differentiation
and maintenance of homeostasis. According to
the current general model of nuclear receptor
action, in the absence of ligand, co-repressor and
other members of the repressor complex are
bound to the receptor, keeping the target gene
silent. However, in the presence of an agonist ligand, co-regulator exchange takes place, which
means that the repressor complex is released and
co-activator with members of the activator complex takes its place. This regulator exchange
results in activation of target gene expression.
This process is viewed as the molecular switch
model, which represents two distinct states of a
rather static system. Due to modern biophysics
and the evolution of microscope technology,
new applications became available in the field
of molecular biology, which made it possible to
investigate transcriptional regulation at increasingly higher time resolution. As the result of
these experiments the earlier static model is
being replaced by a rather dynamic one.'
